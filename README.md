# ESP32-Based-Emergency-Alert-System
I participated in the “Mihai Konteschweller” Competition, where I developed a hazard alert system based on an ESP32 microcontroller, using GPS and GSM modules, an accelerometer, and a microphone to detect accidents or the keyword “Help” and send real-time location alerts via SMS.
